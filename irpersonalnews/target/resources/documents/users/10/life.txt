Why gardening is so much more than a millennial fad to me
My family are one of the lucky few to have an allotment in London. With waiting lists that tend to span years, these plots of land are hard to come by. Hidden in Stockwell, ours seemed like a haven far away from the bustle of the city – and as I child, I loved it. It was full of prickly gooseberries, the most crimson mulberries, sprouting onions and summer strawberries; spending my weekends at our allotment was absolute bliss.

As the child of an adept florist, plants and gardening have always been a big part of my life. My mum, with her seriously green fingers and an astoundingly extensive knowledge of botany, can grow just about anything. Whether it’s an impressive arrangement of flowers stuffed with eucalyptus leaves, or an array of plant shoots, herbs or flower clippings, it always seemed inevitable that my mum’s love of plants and gardening would rub off on me.

And it did, for a while. Growing Club was a beloved after-school activity; nothing filled me with wonder quite like visiting those giant, humid greenhouses in Kew Gardens. And Ground Force was the best makeover show television had to offer, in my eyes.

But the love affair didn’t last forever. What became a Sunday afternoon treat filled with picking vegetables, watering seeds and eating seasonal berries, soon became a chore the older I got.

After all, allotments and gardening weren’t cool, none of my friends gardened and the trendy botanical aesthetic that we millennials now love so much wasn’t in fashion when I was 14.

So, from my teenage years, up until finishing university, owning plants – let alone caring for them – was out of the question. I’d politely decline each time my mum invited me to the allotment, and switch over the channel when the Chelsea Flower Show was on television, pushing down whatever semblance of love I had for it in the past.

But now like many millennials, houseplants have become an obsession. We’re 88 per cent more likely to keep plants in our rooms than over 65 year olds. And I get it, the average age for first-time buyers has increased by seven years and in all this uncertainty, sometimes plants feel like the only thing that can brighten up our overpriced, rented shoe boxes. But they provide much more than just a backdrop for fabulous Instagram pictures.

I fell back in love with plants after getting a small Jade succulent from a colleague at my first ever office job. At first, it was another burden to add on top of my already hefty workload. But caring for it every day and watching it grow gave me more solace than I anticipated. No matter how stressed I was, caring for that one little plant really made feel like everything would be okay. It was the start of me falling back in love with plants and gardening again. That satisfaction of seeing the fruits of my labour never left me.

It sounds silly, but learning to care for plants has really helped me care for myself. I don’t have a child and I don’t have the space or money for pets, but plants do give me a sense of responsibility. On days when I’m feeling down and just want to stay in bed, knowing my plants need watering forces me to get up.

Having something to look after and care for feels so rewarding. I literally reap what I sow, and I get such a kick from all the money I save on herbs now that I grow my own. But one of the best perks about gardening is the time away from my phone, and getting a much-needed breather from the anxieties of social media.

I’m lucky enough to have a small garden in my flat. I have a herb bed with rosemary, sturdy thyme, purple sage and parsley. I’ve picked up great gardening hacks, such as buying potted herbs from the supermarket and planting them myself. I’ve added to my collection, too. Just last week, I planted some sunflowers and white onions, and my bedroom windowsill is filled with succulents. I can’t go to IKEA without coming back with a plant or three, and heading down to Deptford market and buying some cheap potted plants is one of my favourite pastimes.

On top of plants being aesthetically pleasing, they are a life force. Golden pothos, for example, literally purifies the air – it removes benzene and carbon dioxide while replenishing the air with oxygen, making it an ideal plant for the bedroom.

Each plant has a special memory, like my plump gasteria hanging in a macrame, which I got when I first moved house, or my giant tomato plants I bought as a tiny stalk from a summer fair for 50p.

I might not have fingers as green as my mum yet, and I’m still learning as I go – and that’s the process I love the most. The need to care for something is a basic instinct and in an era where we millenials feel so lonely, having plants isn’t just an aesthetic fad; it benefits our mental health too. We should all try and connect a little bit more to nature, it’s an inexpensive hobby, yet brings a world of comfort.Update your home for the new year
As our homes shed their Christmas spirits, decorations are retired to attic-bound boxes and wizened pines are propped miserably against suburban kerbs. For so many, much of the joy of Christmas can be found in the adornment of the home: decking the halls, as it were. I know I’m not alone when I say I feel a tangible sense of loss around this time of year, a festering unfestiveness. Home simply doesn’t feel as special, as decorated or as welcoming in the glaring absence of a large spruce, garnished with trinkets from Christmases past. However, this year, I have taken it upon myself to maintain that sense of playful decoration around my flat. Little flourishes in each room to catch the eye, inexpensive and joyful. So now the baubles have served their time, ‘tis the season for more evergreen accessorising.

Bathroom

It seems only right and fitting to start with some home updates in 2019’s most wanted colour, Pantone’s Living Coral. Add a hit of the vibrant, optimistic and warm shade in your bathroom with a new set of towels. Sheridan Australia’s Living Textures collection is available in aptly named colourway, Coral.

Featuring a ribbed pattern, these 100 per cent cotton towels are ultra-absorbent and irresistibly plush. The collection also includes decadent jewel tones and minimalist neutrals depending on your style. As the trend for open shelving rages on, why not display your new Christmas beauty gifts in your bathroom, rather than stowing them away in a dusty medicine cabinet?

That way, they may actually be used. Nadia McCowan Hill, resident style advisor at Wayfair.co.uk, suggests styling your pampering goodies, candles and any bath time reads on a cocktail trolley, adding that “golden accents like the serving drink trolley by Vical Home on Wayfair.co.uk, will help to create a spa-worthy space.”

Kitchen

Polishing off all the Christmas treats in the pantry is the primary objective of everyone’s January, so why not do it in style? Spread your leftover strawberry conserve from the Christmas hamper on thick-cut toast, fresh from a Smeg X Dolce & Gabana toaster. Never before has a collection of kitchen appliances ignited such excitement, each piece complete with painterly, Italianate motifs and circusiana charm. The highly decorative collection includes kitchen essentials such as a blender, a juicer, and so on. It is poetically named, Sicily is My Love, and while toast is mine, perhaps these pieces can join me in my kitchen too.

All those aboard the Dry January wagon, look away now. Carry the decadence of the Christmas cocktail party into the New Year with a bar accessories set, such as this marble and copper set by Oliver Bonas. As we speed towards the 100th anniversary of the Roaring Twenties, don’t for a minute believe that F Scott Fitzgerald wasn’t knocking back mint juleps in 1919. Turn a corner of your kitchen into a flair bar for year-round festivity. And remember, good booze isn’t just for Christmas.

Bedroom

It goes without saying that the quickest and easiest update you can make to a bedroom is switching up the bedding. Whether you prefer plain white linen or something colourful, the look and feel of your bedroom can be instantly elevated with a bedding update. New homewares brands with an eco-focus are taking over the market, with brands like Urban Collective and Aizome demonstrating new ways that design can be environmentally conscious.

Urban Collective uses recycled materials and bamboo to create its linens, combining Scandi-style and forward thinking manufacturing techniques. Aizome is another new brand operating out of Japan, named after the ancient process of indigo dyeing. Using only organic cotton and natural indigo dye, the linens are certified toxin-free and skin soothing.

One final bedding suggestion is Rise & Fall, the new project from two New Zealand born, UK-based entrepreneurs, Jed Coleman, founder of Caravan Restaurants and Caravan Coffee Roasters and Will Coulton.

The collection of classic white cotton sheets are available in two weaves created using the world’s finest 100% long staple cotton, gossypium barbandense. The best part is, you can sleep even more easily knowing that £3 from each sale goes to Centrepoint, a youth homeless charity that helps people who are sleeping rough.

Another New Zealand brand is Ashley & Co, a home fragrance company fit for any room in the house. Fragrancing your home is one of the best ways to make your space feel more special. Ashley & Co’s collection of fragrances includes home perfume (diffusers) and waxed perfume (candles) in eight signature scents ranging from musky florals to woody citruses. The architectural layering of the notes in the fragrances is designed with the same attention to detail as the shape and style of the elegant glass vessels themselves – the perfect flourish for an empty corner or shelf.

So treat yourself this January, and carry the decorative spirit of Christmas into the New Year.Pale, Male and Stale: Why The BAFTAs Template Needs A Rethink
Thank goodness for the great British public – or at least that sector of it that voted for the EE Rising Star award, and so provided a lacklustre BAFTA awards with its only prize to be won by a person of colour. Micheal Ward took the prize for his brilliant performances in Top Boy and Blue Story and then brought a welcome blast of emotion to a ceremony that was safe, stale, male and pale – and almost entirely predictable.

“Seek out opportunities and see a vision,” he said, with sincerity, as his mother sobbed and waved from the audience. Ward’s presence was a stark reminder of absence elsewhere, a fact that the embarrassed organisers tried to disguise with their choice of presenters and that failsafe British mechanism of self-critical joshing, including an opening segment presented by Asim Chaudhry (Chabuddy G) in the style of a British Airways advertisement.

That was until Joaquin Phoenix stepped up to the podium to collect his best actor BAFTA and, clearly having decided the best actor Oscar is in the bag and it’s time to speak out, threw a grenade into the room by calling on the industry to “do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism”. He included himself in the admonishment, insisting that the “people who have created, perpetuated and benefited from a system of oppression [ought] to be the ones to dismantle it”.

It was an uncomfortable moment in many ways – all too easy to mock given the amount of privilege Phoenix himself carries – but when, later in the ceremony, the president of BAFTA, the Duke of Cambridge (who had spent the night grinning his way uncomfortably through jokes about his family) said that the lack of diversity “simply cannot be right in this day and age”, it’s a sign that the film industry really does have a problem that other areas of the arts have gone much further on the road to remedy.

It’s not the only thing that needs addressing, however, on what felt from the comfort of an armchair like a leaden and laboured night. BAFTA must also decide whether it is a genuinely independent ceremony celebrating films that appeal to British tastes – or simply a harbinger of the Oscars which closes the odds on awards in most categories. It was cheering to see 1917, which follows two British soldiers on a desperate mission, win big; it is a magnificent film which is about much more than its illusion of a single continuous shot, and Sam Mendes was a gracious, articulate winner. But to see it take home seven of the nine awards for which it was nominated when a film as powerful as Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman went home empty-handed seems unduly blinkered.

Scorsese’s collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker, didn’t even win the best editing prize; that went to the showy all-boy mechanics of Le Mans 66, an enjoyable film but not one we will be talking about in even a year’s time. Only Brad Pitt’s win in the best supporting actor category saved Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’s blushes; it also gave Pitt the chance to make a speech in absentia via Margot Robbie and to make one of those royal cracks, saying he will call his prize Harry because he was “excited about bringing it back to the States”.

But Tarantino lost out in the best screenplay category to Bong Joon-Ho’s Parasite (which also picked up the award for best film not in the English language). He applauded but his face was like stone for most of the ceremony; it must be very hard to produce one of the best films of your life yet still have to play the gallant loser for the cameras.

On occasion, the ceremony departed from the predictable and pre-ordained script (Renée Zellweger won best actress for Judy, Laura Dern best supporting actress for Marriage Story). BAFTA’s choice of Jojo Rabbit’s Taika Waititi as best adapted screenplay winner improves its chances in the same category at the Oscars, but it means that the shutout of Greta Gerwig for her imaginative and life-enhancing work on Little Women was complete.

The choice of Joker for the new award for casting – which ignored the ground-breaking multi-racial and colour-blind casting of The Personal History of David Copperfield, as well as the Rolls Royce choices of supporting cast in OUATIH and Marriage Story – felt positively peculiar. Whatever you think of Joker, it is a film built around a single dynamic performance; the others have a richness of acting talent on display that it simply lacks, and it was hard not to feel that perhaps the voters simply went for the film they had watched earliest and knew best.

There were some moments to savour. The arrival of Waad and Hamza al-Kateab and their daughter Sama on stage to collect the best documentary award (with co-director for Edward Watts) for For Sama, which records their life under siege in Aleppo, Syria, was hugely emotional. Waad’s impassioned plea that people should let the 3.5 million people still under bombardment and the heroic medical teams who care for them “hear your voice” was one of the most powerful speeches of the night.

In a lighter vein, there was Hugh Grant’s encounter with his former Bridget Jones’s Diary co-star Zellweger. Before he announced the winner of the best film, he drawled: “First of all, well done Jones. That was a very, very silly little dress, I thought.” Every woman in the room laughed in recognition of a line from the film; many of the men looked marginally baffled.

And then there was Rebel Wilson, one of the few presenters to bring her own script, and what a script it was: scabrous, rude, full of gags about the failure of Cats – “there has been a distinct lack of nominations for felines” – and ending with a delicious dig at the all-male best director shortlist. “I don’t think I could do what they do. Honestly, I just don’t have the balls.”

There were also wins for the distinctly British Bait, a film shot in black and white, on 16mm film, hand processed by its director Mark Jenkin, about two brothers in a Cornish fishing village (in the best debut category) and for the glorious British short animation Grandad Was A Romantic, directed by Maryam Mohajer. The fact that her victory was not shown in the British TV coverage sums up just about everything that was wrong with the BAFTAs in 2020.

Thought cheerleading was all high kicks, pom-poms, and dating jocks? Wrong. The most hyped documentary series on Netflix right now follows the members of a college cheer squad from a small town in Texas as they prepare to defend their national championship – and Olivia Newton-John in Grease it ain’t. The gravity-defying efforts of the fearless (and, frankly, hard as nails) athletes on Cheer have captivated viewers, Kendall Jenner included; the supermodel even pulled off a pretty impressive full extension on Ellen as the cast looked on. Here’s why you need to get “on mat”, and fast.

We could all benefit from a one-to-one session with coach Monica

Navarro College Cheer coach Monica Aldama © Courtesy of Netflix

Navarro College Cheer’s now not-so-secret weapon? Step forward, Monica Aldama. Referred to simply as “the Queen” by her adoring team (“I would take a bullet for that woman,” says flyer Morgan at one point), this perfectionist Southern belle’s methods are of the iron fist in a velvet glove variety, and they’ve made the Navarro name legendary in cheerleading circles. She expects 100 per cent from her athletes off the mat as well as on, and as the series unfolds, it becomes increasingly (and movingly) clear just how invested she is in all aspects of her “kids”’ lives – not just their ability to execute a flawless full out. A composed, even taciturn presence at first, you’ll wonder why the squad is so obsessed with her. By the third episode, you’ll wish she was your cheer mom.

There are as many tales of triumph over adversity as there are nail-biting stunts

For many of these teens, the threat of cracking a rib in training is nothing compared to what they’ve been through outside the gym. From poverty, neglect, sexual abuse and suicide attempts to devastating loss and run-ins with the law, several credit the structure, support and sense of belonging that being on the team has given them with saving their lives.

Be more like Jerry Harris is our 2020 mantra

It takes approximately half an episode to fall in love with Jerry Harris, and that’s before learning that he tragically lost his mother at age 16. An adorable bundle of positivity and good vibes, we’d like the team’s unofficial mascot to mat talk us into work each morning (we’d probably just backflip our way to our desks). Expect to become deeply invested in whether or not Jerry makes mat.

The teammates’ bond is heart-warming

We should expect nothing less from cheerleaders, but the way the athletes support, encourage and motivate one another is genuinely heart-warming. If the pep talk Jerry is given in the heart-pounding final seconds before they take to the stage in Daytona doesn’t move you to tears, you should probably check you still have a pulse.

The team is all about inclusivity

Corsicana, Texas, is conservative, Christian, and unlikely to be a wholly comfortable environment for the gay members of the team. But Navarro is a haven for cheerleaders like La’Darius Marshall, who describes how it made him feel truly accepted after being subjected to homophobic bullying as a child. “I might be a little bit old-school with values and stuff like that, but I get angry,” says Aldama, herself a Christian. “I will debate you up one side and down the other if you talk about my boys. You know, those are my kids. I’ll fight tooth and nail for them,” she says. You believe her.

Marriage Story

If you’re in need of a good cry this weekend, allow me to recommend Marriage Story – Noah Baumbach’s utterly brilliant depiction of a marriage slowly falling apart and individual lives slowly coming together. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson earned well-deserved Best Actor and Best Actress nods for their starring roles, while Laura Dern is tipped to win Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of manic, tea-swilling divorce lawyer Nora (who, incidentally, would probably get along like a house on fire with Dern’s Big Little Lies character Renata Klein). Pour yourself a glass of Pinot Noir, brush up on your knowledge of Stephen Sondheim’s Company, and enjoy.

The Edge Of Democracy

Director Petra Costa marries the political and the personal in her study of the history of democracy in her native Brazil. “Brazilian democracy and I are almost the same age,” the 36 year old points out in the film’s trailer while home video footage of her casting her first election ballot plays in the background. She specifically hones in on the deep-rooted corruption within the Worker’s Party, which resulted in the imprisonment of former President Lula (2003-2010) and the impeachment of his successor in office, Dilma Rousseff (2011-2016). Nominated for Best Documentary Feature, it’s essential viewing following the controversial election of Brazil’s current President Jair Bolsonaro at the end of 2019.

The Irishman

With a runtime of three hours and 29 minutes, Martin Scorsese’s latest mob epic is a commitment – but one that’s well worth making. Based on I Heard You Paint Houses, former homicide prosecutor Charles Brandt’s study of the murder of Jimmy Hoffa, it charts the life of hit man Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran, played exquisitely by Robert De Niro, as he falls in with mafia kingpin Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), ultimately serving as bodyguard to the wheeling and dealing labour union leader Hoffa. With no less than 10 Oscar nominations this year, including Best Picture and Best Director, it’s a must-watch.

I Lost My Body

Adapted from a novel by the screenwriter behind Amélie, I Lost My Body is one of the most bizarrely wonderful films to make its way to the Oscars in recent years. Nominated for Best Animated Feature, the macabre plot chronicles a severed hand’s quest to be reunited with its owner Naoufel – a pizza delivery boy whose life, including his nostalgia-inducing childhood in Morocco, is gradually revealed through flashbacks. (Notably, the character is voiced in English by none other than Dev Patel.) Just as remarkable as the Studio Ghibli-inspired ethos of the film? The electronic score by Dan Levy, who director Jérémy Clapin refers to as the drama’s co-author.

The Two Popes

The latest from Brazilian director Fernanco Meirelles (City of God and The Constant Gardener), The Two Popes is a fictional account of the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI following the Vatican leaks and the ascension of Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio – now Pope Francis – to the head of the church. Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce are nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor for their roles as Benedict and Francis, respectively – but more than their individual performances, it’s the chemistry and banter between the two Hollywood veterans throughout this quietly moving film that make it so enjoyable to watch.

American Factory

Made by Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions and nominated for Best Documentary Feature, this fascinating documentary chronicles the lives of the employees of an auto-glass manufacturing plant in Dayton, Ohio, run by a mammoth Chinese company named Fuyao. Directors Steven Bognar and Julia Reichert – who shot a previous documentary in the factory when it was first closed by General Motors – delicately juxtapose the beliefs of American and Chinese employees, who work side-by-side in high-risk jobs. A stunning portrait of how the global economy is reshaping our lives for better and for worse.
