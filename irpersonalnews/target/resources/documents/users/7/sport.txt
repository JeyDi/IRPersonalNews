Webb Simpson birdied the last two holes before beating Tony Finau in a play-off to win the Phoenix Open in Arizona.

The 34-year-old American two-putted from 50 feet on the 17th and then holed a 17-foot attempt on the last, while Finau missed an eight-foot putt to win.

That left the players tied on 17 under and Simpson claimed his sixth PGA Tour title with another birdie putt, from 10 feet, at the first extra hole.

"I didn't have my best stuff but I hung in there," said Simpson.

"To come down to the last couple of holes and then birdie 18 twice feels great."

Simpson started the final round one shot behind Finau and drew level with a birdie on the fifth hole.

However, after hitting his drive into the water on the 15th he dropped a shot to fall two behind with three to play.

Both players parred the par-three 16th - the hole surrounded by raucous fans - as the PGA Tour honoured basketball great Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash last week.

Tournament organisers used Bryant's LA Lakers jersey numbers of eight and 24 to determine the location of the 16th hole pin in Scottsdale. The flag also featured his numbers with a purple eight on one side, and 24 on the other.

American world number 13 Finau and Justin Thomas - who finished tied for third on 14 under - also wore replicas of Bryant's jersey on the 16th hole.

Simpson's winning birdie run started when he drove the green on the par-four 17th before completing his first victory since the 2018 Players Championship with two more on the 18th as Finau faltered.

"It's a bitter week as I look back on it," said Finau. "But lots of stuff to be learned.

"I had a chance, a great chance to win this week. Unfortunately, it didn't happen, but my game's better than it's ever been."Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 Manchester City: Steven Bergwijn scores superb debut volley as Spurs win bad-tempered affair
Steven Bergwijn is the 250th player to score on his Premier League debut, and the 13th Dutchman.

Steven Bergwijn marked his debut with a superb volley as Tottenham won a bad-tempered Premier League affair with 10-man Manchester City to boost their top-four hopes.

The result lifts Spurs to fifth, four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, while City remain second, 22 points behind leaders Liverpool who can win the title on 21 March when they play Crystal Palace.

The 22-year-old's goal came with Spurs' first shot on target, after Oleksandr Zinchenko had been dismissed for a second yellow card and City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan had seen a first-half penalty saved by Hugo Lloris.

Son Heung-min's effort, which deflected off Fernandinho as it flew past City goalkeeper Ederson into the bottom left corner confirmed a valuable victory for the hosts.

Pep Guardiola's City side had arrived in London chasing their fifth league win in six games and dominated possession but failed to convert a glut of glorious chances.

Lloris brilliantly flicked a Sergio Aguero effort on to the post and the Argentine was then at the centre of a chaotic few minutes towards the end of the first half, winning a penalty awarded by VAR following Serge Aurier's clumsy challenge.

Gundogan however, saw his spot-kick - which took four minutes to be given - saved by Spurs keeper Lloris, with VAR then asked to rule on whether the France goalkeeper had fouled City's Raheem Sterling as both pursued the rebound.

Tottenham's Toby Alderweireld and Zinchenko were booked as both sets of players confronted each other in the aftermath, while Spurs boss Jose Mourinho appeared angered at the referee's failure to book Sterling for diving when a second penalty was not awarded.

Sterling had earlier appeared fortunate to escape with only a 12th-minute booking, after replays showed his studs landing on the ankle and lower shin of Spurs midfielder Dele Alli.

City though were reduced to 10 men after the break, with Ukrainian Zinchenko receiving his marching orders for a foul on Harry Winks.

That allowed Spurs to gain a foothold in the game, with Bergwijn firing Lucas Moura's clever cross into the bottom right corner from 15 yards to set them on their way.

Until the hour mark this had looked like being another occasion on which Spurs were going to sorely miss Harry Kane as the focal point of their attack.

Son and Moura provided dynamism and debutant Bergwijn showed some neat touches, but Kane's ability to hold the ball and bring others into play was absent as the hosts repelled wave after wave of City attacks.

And then the game dramatically swung in Tottenham's favour, thanks largely to Winks' surge forward which drew Zinchenko into a rash challenge and hastened his early departure.

City, who had been readying Gabriel Jesus, were suddenly forced into a rethink and while they attempted to reorganise Spurs went ahead.

Bergwijn, who arrived at the club on Wednesday in a Â£27m deal from PSV Eindhoven had last scored on 7 December against Fortuna Sittard.

But there was nothing routine about the way he introduced himself to supporters of the north London club - capping a tenacious display with a fine goal.

It marked a dream debut for the Netherlands winger, who pulled up with cramp in the second half, but who was afforded a hero's ovation when he was withdrawn after 70 minutes.

While Spurs manager Mourinho cut a frustrated figure in the first period over perceived injustices, the roles were reversed after the break with his old nemesis Guardiola appearing exasperated by his own team.

Having reminded his City side to be "more clinical" after their Manchester derby loss on Wednesday, he appeared agitated by their first-half penalty miss and the decision not to award them a second penalty.

And that was compounded two minutes into the second period when German midfielder Gundogan missed a gilt-edged chance, firing over from six yards after Sterling had laid the ball into his path and Aguero's initial effort was cleared off the line by Alderweireld.

The champions had 18 shots but only hit the target five times and both substitute Jesus and Bernardo Silva were unable to convert late chances.

City's lack of cutting edge ensured a sixth defeat of the season, which is as many as in their past two title-winning campaigns combined.

'It happened again' - what they said

Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho told BBC Match of the Day: "With a few draws of people in the same area of the table as us, it was very important to get three points. We still have an eye on fourth. It was a match where you know the quality of the opponent. You want to win, but you can lose. I'm delighted with the boys.

"Only [VAR] Kevin Friend can explain why it was not a red card [for Raheem Sterling]. He has the chance to watch again. That decision would change the game. It would probably not be such an enjoyable game, one team with one player more for an hour is a big advantage. I think it's a clear red card."

On Steven Bergwijn's goal: "It's the best way to come to a club. We were not putting pressure on him. We signed him early in the week, so we had time for him to train and speak. He's very intelligent, humble. At home against the champions, to score a goal, not a normal goal, couldn't be better for him."

On beating Pep Guardiola: "It's a pleasure to get three points in a match where we knew it would be very difficult. I have better feelings for Pep than you can imagine. We worked together for three years."

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola told Sky Sports: "We played well but lost the game. It happened again. They had two shots and scored two goals.

"I don't have too many things to say about the performance. We have to accept it and analyse it. It is not easy. We did really well, honestly.

"With this performance, how should I be critical? This performance would be an incredible mistake to say how bad they are. We created chances and conceded few.

"A few times this season it has happened. The sending off was a key point. We said at half-time be careful, yellow cards are a fast and quick action."

Another City player sees red - the stats

Spurs picked up their first Premier League win against Manchester City since October 2016, which was also a 2-0 victory on home soil (at White Hart Lane).

Manchester City have now lost six games in the Premier League this season, their joint-most in a single campaign under manager Pep Guardiola (six in 2016-17).

Spurs boss Jose Mourinho picked up his sixth win against Guardiola across all competitions - only Jurgen Klopp has defeated him on more occasions (8). However, Mourinho has now won against Guardiola with four different teams (Inter Milan, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Spurs), the most of any manager.

Manchester City have gone consecutive games without scoring for the first time under Guardiola, having last done so back in March 2016 under Manuel Pellegrini (three games without a goal).

Steven Bergwijn's opener for Spurs saw him become the 250th player to score on his debut in the Premier League, and the 13th Dutchman to do so.

Since the start of 2016-17, only Jamie Vardy (6) has scored more goals against Guardiola's Manchester City than Spurs' Son Heung-min (5) across all competitions.

Manchester City have failed to score four of the last six penalties they have taken across all competitions, with three different players accounting for these failed spot-kicks (Gabriel Jesus x2, Raheem Sterling and Ilkay Gundogan).

Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has saved three of the last four penalties he has faced in the Premier League - indeed, the Frenchman has now made the joint-most penalty saves for the club in the competition (five - along with Heurelho Gomes).

Oleksandr Zinchenko became the third Manchester City player to be sent off in the Premier League this season - no team have been awarded more red cards than Guardiola's side in 2019-20.

Neymar arrives at his white-themed party in a suit and matching fedora. He turns 28 on Wednesday

Neymar celebrated his upcoming 28th birthday with a lavish party at Parisian nightclub Yoyo on Sunday.

Paris St-Germain manager Thomas Tuchel skipped the white-themed party under the Palais de Tokyo, after branding it "a distraction", with the event coming just two days before their next game.

It appeared to be a sentiment not shared by the Brazilian's team-mates and celebrity pals however, with Edinson Cavani, Marco Verratti and Angel di Maria embracing the dress code and injured Lyon winger Memphis Depay sporting a pair of Â£1,200 boots.

Serial party host Neymar is well known for his extravagant get-togethers, but it was reported that Neymar would rein in his celebrations this year before his actual birthday on Wednesday.

He threw a 'Nuit Rouge' themed event for his 27th birthday for around 200 guests, while he welcomed in his 26th birthday with a black tie event attended by Lewis Hamilton and the president of Brazil.

Sunday's bash came a day after PSG's bad-tempered 5-0 victory against Montpellier, that was notable for incidents involving a pink-haired Neymar and team-mate Kylian Mbappe.

Neymar shrugged off an injury scare, taunted the opposition with his signature tricks and raged at the officials.

Mbappe, 21, reacted angrily to being substituted midway through the second half.

"These are distractions, and they give the impression we are not serious, not professional," said Tuchel, in his post-match comments when discussing Neymar's party.

But on Tuesday, he denied he had a personal issue with Neymar.

"It's my choice not to participate in the party," Tuchel said. "It's a choice as a coach; it's not against Neymar personally."

Mbappe appeared to skip the party all together, instead opting to watch the Kansas City Chiefs win the Super Bowl after attending an event at Disneyland Paris.

Maybe he couldn't find anything white to wear...Football news - 'No hard feelings' says Spurs' Alli on Sterling's mistimed tackle
Sterling's attempt to win the ball saw him step on Alli's ankle but the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) did not deem the challenge worthy of a red card, angering Spurs boss Jose Mourinho who was adamant the England man should have been sent off.

Alli carried on playing before he was substituted in the 70th minute and Spurs, who play an FA Cup fourth round replay against Southampton on Wednesday, are yet to provide an update on the severity of his injury.

"There are no hard feelings. He is a fantastic player and we move on."

The tackle was similar to last month's incident where Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was sent off on VAR review and banned for three games when his mistimed tackle nearly injured Crystal Palace's Max Meyer.

Djokovicâs eighth title in Melbourne, sealed with a five-set win over Dominic Thiem, moved him to within three of Federer in the all-time charts.

The 32-year-old now has his sights on surpassing the Swiss great, conceding that he probably has two seasons to achieve it before the rigors of fatherhood take over.

"At this stage of my career, Grand Slams matter the most. Trying to reach that historic number one is something I would love to achieve and Iâm working towards that," Djokovic said in front of ecstatic Serbian fans on Eurosport.

"Being a father, I really want to participate in the upbringing of my children. I want to spend quality time with them, so I know that the moment I slow down and selectively play tournaments is coming very close.

"I want to have a shot at number one, itâs going to be this year or next year. Iâm going to try and give it all and reach that."

So can Djokovic do it â and if so, when might he achieve it?

Wilander: Djokovic can hit 19 majors in 2020

Eurosport expert Mats Wilander is backing Djokovic to win two more Slams in 2020 to move within one of Federer.

"So winning here, does that make him the favourite at Wimbledon where he is defending? Yes, thatâs 18. [It] makes him the favourite at the US Open, thatâs 19," Wilander said.

"At the end of the year, we could have two players on 20 or two on 19 or even more because Novak had can win all four."

"This is a huge win for him going forwards. A loss here would have been very difficult to get confidence and come back. But the door is open for him to start climbing through it and talk about being the greatest ever."

When could the magic No.21 arrive?

Firstly, this assumes Federer will not win another Slam. The Swissâ groin issue in Melbourne highlighted the troubles of transporting a 38-year-old frame through a two-week tournament, but he canât be completely discounted. Wimbledon remains his best hope, his serve capable of keeping matches super short, but can he banish memories of last yearâs choke against Djokovic?

Itâs all hypothetical but Djokovic still looks primed for a sixth Wimbledon title (18). But winning the US Open immediately afterwards is far from certain given heâs won 'just' one of the last four editions. A more conservative estimate would suggest No.19 arrives in Melbourne next year before Djokovic wins a fourth straight Wimbledon (20). As for No.21? Given his vow to tone down his commitments after the 2021 season, all his efforts can fix on one final flourish at the US Open.

Of course, there are plenty of problems with this prophecyâ¦

The Nadal and Next Gen factors

Djokovic is four unanswered Slams from taking top spot in the menâs game â but that relies on two men coming up short.

Rafael Nadal also has a strong claim to the GOAT throne, despite winning 63% of his majors at the same event. The French Open has provided a constant source of joy for the Spaniard, who will go for a ridiculous 13th title in Paris this summer. Should he triumph, he too would be on 20 titles.

But if Nadal is a threat to Djokovic, then who is the threat to Nadal?

Step forward, Dominic Thiem. The Austrian looks the only player capable of beating Nadal on clay, having done so in each of the last four seasons. The 26-year-old has lost the past two French Open finals to Nadal, taking just one set, but his victory over him in Melbourne will fuel belief that he can do it again on his favoured surface.

And itâs not just Thiem threatening to break through. Alexander Zverev finally performed at a five-set event in Australia, Daniil Medvedev emerged as a likable villain when he almost beat Nadal in the 2019 US Open final and Stefanos Tsitsipas looks a huge talent after he won the ATP Finals in London last year.

Djokovic, Nadal and (to some extent) Federer are managing their physical decline by maintaining their aura of invincibility â much like the latter years of Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson â accepting that their Next Gen rivals will occasionally blast them off court, but will lack the belief and consistency to knock them out at majors. But the talent gap has finally been bridged and freebie Slams will soon be in the past for the Big Three.

The upshot? Federer may already be safe of 20 titles. Or, perhaps, Djokovic and Nadal could join him on 20 and then find it impossible to win that elusive 21st...
