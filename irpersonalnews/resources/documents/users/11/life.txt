Update your home for the new year
As our homes shed their Christmas spirits, decorations are retired to attic-bound boxes and wizened pines are propped miserably against suburban kerbs. For so many, much of the joy of Christmas can be found in the adornment of the home: decking the halls, as it were. I know I’m not alone when I say I feel a tangible sense of loss around this time of year, a festering unfestiveness. Home simply doesn’t feel as special, as decorated or as welcoming in the glaring absence of a large spruce, garnished with trinkets from Christmases past. However, this year, I have taken it upon myself to maintain that sense of playful decoration around my flat. Little flourishes in each room to catch the eye, inexpensive and joyful. So now the baubles have served their time, ‘tis the season for more evergreen accessorising.

Bathroom

It seems only right and fitting to start with some home updates in 2019’s most wanted colour, Pantone’s Living Coral. Add a hit of the vibrant, optimistic and warm shade in your bathroom with a new set of towels. Sheridan Australia’s Living Textures collection is available in aptly named colourway, Coral.

Featuring a ribbed pattern, these 100 per cent cotton towels are ultra-absorbent and irresistibly plush. The collection also includes decadent jewel tones and minimalist neutrals depending on your style. As the trend for open shelving rages on, why not display your new Christmas beauty gifts in your bathroom, rather than stowing them away in a dusty medicine cabinet?

That way, they may actually be used. Nadia McCowan Hill, resident style advisor at Wayfair.co.uk, suggests styling your pampering goodies, candles and any bath time reads on a cocktail trolley, adding that “golden accents like the serving drink trolley by Vical Home on Wayfair.co.uk, will help to create a spa-worthy space.”

Kitchen

Polishing off all the Christmas treats in the pantry is the primary objective of everyone’s January, so why not do it in style? Spread your leftover strawberry conserve from the Christmas hamper on thick-cut toast, fresh from a Smeg X Dolce & Gabana toaster. Never before has a collection of kitchen appliances ignited such excitement, each piece complete with painterly, Italianate motifs and circusiana charm. The highly decorative collection includes kitchen essentials such as a blender, a juicer, and so on. It is poetically named, Sicily is My Love, and while toast is mine, perhaps these pieces can join me in my kitchen too.

All those aboard the Dry January wagon, look away now. Carry the decadence of the Christmas cocktail party into the New Year with a bar accessories set, such as this marble and copper set by Oliver Bonas. As we speed towards the 100th anniversary of the Roaring Twenties, don’t for a minute believe that F Scott Fitzgerald wasn’t knocking back mint juleps in 1919. Turn a corner of your kitchen into a flair bar for year-round festivity. And remember, good booze isn’t just for Christmas.

Bedroom

It goes without saying that the quickest and easiest update you can make to a bedroom is switching up the bedding. Whether you prefer plain white linen or something colourful, the look and feel of your bedroom can be instantly elevated with a bedding update. New homewares brands with an eco-focus are taking over the market, with brands like Urban Collective and Aizome demonstrating new ways that design can be environmentally conscious.

Urban Collective uses recycled materials and bamboo to create its linens, combining Scandi-style and forward thinking manufacturing techniques. Aizome is another new brand operating out of Japan, named after the ancient process of indigo dyeing. Using only organic cotton and natural indigo dye, the linens are certified toxin-free and skin soothing.

One final bedding suggestion is Rise & Fall, the new project from two New Zealand born, UK-based entrepreneurs, Jed Coleman, founder of Caravan Restaurants and Caravan Coffee Roasters and Will Coulton.

The collection of classic white cotton sheets are available in two weaves created using the world’s finest 100% long staple cotton, gossypium barbandense. The best part is, you can sleep even more easily knowing that £3 from each sale goes to Centrepoint, a youth homeless charity that helps people who are sleeping rough.

Another New Zealand brand is Ashley & Co, a home fragrance company fit for any room in the house. Fragrancing your home is one of the best ways to make your space feel more special. Ashley & Co’s collection of fragrances includes home perfume (diffusers) and waxed perfume (candles) in eight signature scents ranging from musky florals to woody citruses. The architectural layering of the notes in the fragrances is designed with the same attention to detail as the shape and style of the elegant glass vessels themselves – the perfect flourish for an empty corner or shelf.

So treat yourself this January, and carry the decorative spirit of Christmas into the New Year.Pale, Male and Stale: Why The BAFTAs Template Needs A Rethink
Thank goodness for the great British public – or at least that sector of it that voted for the EE Rising Star award, and so provided a lacklustre BAFTA awards with its only prize to be won by a person of colour. Micheal Ward took the prize for his brilliant performances in Top Boy and Blue Story and then brought a welcome blast of emotion to a ceremony that was safe, stale, male and pale – and almost entirely predictable.

“Seek out opportunities and see a vision,” he said, with sincerity, as his mother sobbed and waved from the audience. Ward’s presence was a stark reminder of absence elsewhere, a fact that the embarrassed organisers tried to disguise with their choice of presenters and that failsafe British mechanism of self-critical joshing, including an opening segment presented by Asim Chaudhry (Chabuddy G) in the style of a British Airways advertisement.

That was until Joaquin Phoenix stepped up to the podium to collect his best actor BAFTA and, clearly having decided the best actor Oscar is in the bag and it’s time to speak out, threw a grenade into the room by calling on the industry to “do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism”. He included himself in the admonishment, insisting that the “people who have created, perpetuated and benefited from a system of oppression [ought] to be the ones to dismantle it”.

It was an uncomfortable moment in many ways – all too easy to mock given the amount of privilege Phoenix himself carries – but when, later in the ceremony, the president of BAFTA, the Duke of Cambridge (who had spent the night grinning his way uncomfortably through jokes about his family) said that the lack of diversity “simply cannot be right in this day and age”, it’s a sign that the film industry really does have a problem that other areas of the arts have gone much further on the road to remedy.

It’s not the only thing that needs addressing, however, on what felt from the comfort of an armchair like a leaden and laboured night. BAFTA must also decide whether it is a genuinely independent ceremony celebrating films that appeal to British tastes – or simply a harbinger of the Oscars which closes the odds on awards in most categories. It was cheering to see 1917, which follows two British soldiers on a desperate mission, win big; it is a magnificent film which is about much more than its illusion of a single continuous shot, and Sam Mendes was a gracious, articulate winner. But to see it take home seven of the nine awards for which it was nominated when a film as powerful as Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman went home empty-handed seems unduly blinkered.

Scorsese’s collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker, didn’t even win the best editing prize; that went to the showy all-boy mechanics of Le Mans 66, an enjoyable film but not one we will be talking about in even a year’s time. Only Brad Pitt’s win in the best supporting actor category saved Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’s blushes; it also gave Pitt the chance to make a speech in absentia via Margot Robbie and to make one of those royal cracks, saying he will call his prize Harry because he was “excited about bringing it back to the States”.

But Tarantino lost out in the best screenplay category to Bong Joon-Ho’s Parasite (which also picked up the award for best film not in the English language). He applauded but his face was like stone for most of the ceremony; it must be very hard to produce one of the best films of your life yet still have to play the gallant loser for the cameras.

On occasion, the ceremony departed from the predictable and pre-ordained script (Renée Zellweger won best actress for Judy, Laura Dern best supporting actress for Marriage Story). BAFTA’s choice of Jojo Rabbit’s Taika Waititi as best adapted screenplay winner improves its chances in the same category at the Oscars, but it means that the shutout of Greta Gerwig for her imaginative and life-enhancing work on Little Women was complete.

The choice of Joker for the new award for casting – which ignored the ground-breaking multi-racial and colour-blind casting of The Personal History of David Copperfield, as well as the Rolls Royce choices of supporting cast in OUATIH and Marriage Story – felt positively peculiar. Whatever you think of Joker, it is a film built around a single dynamic performance; the others have a richness of acting talent on display that it simply lacks, and it was hard not to feel that perhaps the voters simply went for the film they had watched earliest and knew best.

There were some moments to savour. The arrival of Waad and Hamza al-Kateab and their daughter Sama on stage to collect the best documentary award (with co-director for Edward Watts) for For Sama, which records their life under siege in Aleppo, Syria, was hugely emotional. Waad’s impassioned plea that people should let the 3.5 million people still under bombardment and the heroic medical teams who care for them “hear your voice” was one of the most powerful speeches of the night.

In a lighter vein, there was Hugh Grant’s encounter with his former Bridget Jones’s Diary co-star Zellweger. Before he announced the winner of the best film, he drawled: “First of all, well done Jones. That was a very, very silly little dress, I thought.” Every woman in the room laughed in recognition of a line from the film; many of the men looked marginally baffled.

And then there was Rebel Wilson, one of the few presenters to bring her own script, and what a script it was: scabrous, rude, full of gags about the failure of Cats – “there has been a distinct lack of nominations for felines” – and ending with a delicious dig at the all-male best director shortlist. “I don’t think I could do what they do. Honestly, I just don’t have the balls.”

There were also wins for the distinctly British Bait, a film shot in black and white, on 16mm film, hand processed by its director Mark Jenkin, about two brothers in a Cornish fishing village (in the best debut category) and for the glorious British short animation Grandad Was A Romantic, directed by Maryam Mohajer. The fact that her victory was not shown in the British TV coverage sums up just about everything that was wrong with the BAFTAs in 2020.
