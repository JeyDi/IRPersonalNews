Britons struggle to find time for a cup of tea as stress takes its toll, study claims
A study of 2,000 adults found a fast pace of life combined with rising work pressures and a phone that never stops means few people "switch off".

Other factors include the stress of being a parent, longer commuting times and financial pressures amid rising costs of living.

Two thirds of those polled believe a lifestyle that leaves no time to decompress is taking its toll on health and emotional wellbeing.

The research found those who do find the time, only do so for an average of 54 minutes a day.

The research also found the difficulties we have switching off mean we’re left feeling "mentally frazzled" twice a week on average.

Four in 10 admit their difficulty in unwinding has had a negative impact on their home life. More than half are so busy they have no time to take a tea break.

However, six in 10 feel said they feel apprehensive about straying from their daily routine.

Despite this, the Twinings research carried out through OnePoll, found many of those polled have made changes to their daily routine to help them better relax.

These include taking longer tea breaks during their working day, not looking at their mobile devices in the evening and reading a book before going to bed.

Other methods include taking more tea breaks, doing exercise and enforcing a ‘no talking about work’ rule when at home.
