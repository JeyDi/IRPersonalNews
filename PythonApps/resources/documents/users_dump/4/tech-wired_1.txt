The first teaser for Marvel‚Äôs TV shows is here, and they look expensive

Alongside trailers for No Time to Die, Mulan, Black Widow and Minions: The Rise of Gru, a 30-second teaser during the Super Bowl offered Marvel fans a first glimpse at the MCU‚Äôs slate of new TV shows, which are coming to Disney+ this year and next.

There were clips from The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, which sees Captain America‚Äôs two best mates following in his footsteps ‚Äì expect lots of shield-hurling, bullet-dodging action. WandaVision ‚Äì which picks up the story arc of, you guessed it, Wanda and Vision ‚Äì teased some trippy sitcom-style time travel that must have been a nightmare for the wardrobe department, while we saw just the briefest flash of Tom Hiddleston‚Äôs Loki threatening, as per usual, to burn everything to the ground.

It‚Äôs difficult to draw too many conclusions from the short teaser, but one thing is clear ‚Äì this is a markedly different era for the MCU‚Äôs TV properties in terms of budgets and production values. Previous efforts like Agents of Shield and even the well-received Jessica Jones were operating in the network drama bracket (think CSI). Now we‚Äôre in HBO territory. These are going to be huge.

The best show of the decade has come to an end

Netflix

The WIRED office spent most of December arguing about what to put in our best of the decade lists, but when it came to television, the number one choice was pretty much unanimous. BoJack Horseman is funny, incisive and desperately sad. Although the lead character is a brash, boorish middle-aged man-horse, the show broke new ground in its treatment of female characters in animation. The final six episodes landed on Netflix on Friday ‚Äì fans of the show will not be expecting a happy ending.

Sandler divides opinion, but he‚Äôs clearly doing the business for Netflix, which just ordered another four movies from his production company.

Alright, we have to hand it to you Nige ‚Äì day three, and society hasn‚Äôt collapsed yet (except in one tower block in Norwich). But we‚Äôre still in the transition period, and given the tone of the prime minister‚Äôs statements, we could be looking at the breakdown of trade talks and a no-deal exit from the European Union at the end of the year. Management game Not Tonight: Take Back Control edition, from the makers of the widely praised Papers, Please! puts the player in a dystopian post-Brexit ruled by an extreme far-right government where, driven from your old life by the chaos, you‚Äôre forced to pick up casual work as a bouncer.
