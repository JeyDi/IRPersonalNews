Information Retrieval Personal News Search System



In the Web 2.0 era one of the most important and relevant aspects is to try to organize, filter andselect news and information in a way that is more relevant to our interests, our purpose and our goal.

This result can be achieved thanks to search engines, but above all thanks to recommendation enginesthat allow to select, filter and propose to the user only a series of relevant contents and informationin order to be able to unravel more effectively in the digital jungle of constant content.

This aspect of dynamism and speed of information is particularly relevant in the world of social net-works.

This project therefore proposes an automatic system that allows the user to filter messages on twitterbased on several factors:  words written by the user, some reference topics and articles previously readby the user himself in order to provide different levels of customization of the information.

The project is part of the Information Retrieval master degree exam at Universit`a degli Studi Milano-Bicocca.
